desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When accessing http(s)://FQDN/univention/udm/schema/ and  http(s)://FQDN/univention/udm/openapi.json
   authentication is now required by default. ucr set directory/manager/rest/require-auth=no can be used to disable this.
   After setting this UCR Variable the univention-directory-manager-rest service needs to be restarted.
